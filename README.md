# DMProject2017

Tasks: 

- Data cleaning. (Done, see if there's any more need for it). filtered_data.csv is the filtered data, original.csv is the original data file. 
- Data visualization. (Come up with some interesting visualizations of data that help understands the data in a better way).
- Apply all the classification algorithms that we have learnt and try to compare it's performance. (visualisations here can help too).
- Figure out if we can do classification on multiple features in one go. If yes, do it. Otherwise, we'll run the algorithms separately for 3 features (applied, disliked, liked)
- PCA and clustering maybe? (good if we can do these).
